# The Dining Philosophers
# Five introspective and introverted philosophers are sitting at a circular 
# table. In front of each philosopher is a plate of food. A fork (or a 
# chopstick) lies between each philosopher, one by the philosopherâ€™s left hand 
# and one by the right hand. A philosopher cannot eat until he or she has both 
# forks in hand. Forks are picked up one at a time. If a fork is unavailable, 
# the philosopher simply waits for the fork to be freed. When a philosopher 
# has two forks, he or she eats a few bites and then returns both forks to the 
# table. If a philosopher cannot obtain both forks for a long time, he or she 
# will starve. Is there an algorithm that will ensure that no philosophers 
# starve?
